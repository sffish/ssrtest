# Negligible Matters

Negligible Matters is my poem website, which is also a demo for SSR(server-side-rendering) pages, build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It loads poems dynamically from `*.md` files in the `/markdown` directory, and renders poem pages on server side, so that they look like statically hosted. Content of poems can be easily changed via editing the `*.md` files.  

## Demo
http://sffish.me/demo/



## Install
```
npm  install
```

- start the sever in development
```
node server.js
```
The site will be served at `localhost:3000/`.
